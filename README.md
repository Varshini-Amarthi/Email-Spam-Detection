# Email-Spam-Detection
A small project for email spam detection using machine learning modules.
Email spam detection system is used to detect email spam using Machine Learning technique called Natural Language Processing and Python.
In this project we have a dataset contain a lot of emails by extract important words and then use naive classifier we can detect if this email is spam or not.
Spam filters are designed to identify emails that attackers or marketers use to send unwanted or dangerous content.
They use specific filtering methods to identify the content of emails or their senders and then flag the email as spam. 
The email can then be automatically deleted instantly or after a period of time.
So finally,the main purpose of this project is to check the accuracy_score of the "Email Spam Detection" by using "NLP"(Natural Language Processing)
